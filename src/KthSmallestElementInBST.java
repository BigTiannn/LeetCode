/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/#/description
 * Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth 
 * smallest element in it.
 * Note: 
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 <= k <= BST's total elements.
 * Follow up:
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to 
 * find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
